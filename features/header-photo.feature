Feature: Header Photo
  In order to showcase our meetings
  As a visitor
  I should see a random header photo selected from a pre-selection

#  Scenario: Show pictures
#    Given Meetup API returns "10" photos
#     When I go to "/"
#     Then I should see an ".photo-bar" element
#      And I should see an ".photo" element

  Scenario: Show Header Image

  Scenario: Fallback when no pre-selection

  Scenario: Shown Image must be from pre-selection
